Inspired by my 2018-2020 AP Physics 1/2 classes

Simple moon landing simulator game with:
- Realistic calculation of acceleration based on mass, engine throttle, and specific impulse
- Simulation of centrifugal and coriolis forces (the moon isn't flat)
- Multiple levels of increasing difficulty, with possibility of non-fatal, random glitches on later levels
- A random terrain generator which increases in roughness on later levels
